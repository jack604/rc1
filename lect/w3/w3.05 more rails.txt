If action method is empty, it can be removed.
As long as proper route defined and properly named view file/template,
the action method does not have to be there and Rails will find the correct tempalte by convention.
(from controller class)

View should have as little ruby code logic as possible.

moving business logic out:
def hello
	random_names=["a","b","c"]
	@name = random_names.sample
	@time = Time.now
	@times_displayed ||= 0
	@times_displayed +=1
	end
end

Ok skillnad från t.ex. Servlets (java) kan man inte lagra variabelvärden mellan requests i controller-delen.
alternativ:
sessions (http session)
database

instance variables in the controller are available to view.
??? model då?

? ev. kolla igen ca 1:10 i videon w3.06 eller vad det var (helpers)
Helpers:
format how the time looks:
in view? but: not reusable
controller? should be "view format" agnostic.

Helpers to the rescue:
helpers are view helpers.
code goes into view but should be reusable so separate ruby class.
(skapas när man kör rails generate eller vad det hette).

methods inside helpers are available to any view in application (also to any controller typ).

använd:
straight forward, bara anropa metoden i view-filen.

Rails provides build in helpers (helper methods): ?? kolla igen ?? helpers 4:20 ca.
link_to name, path
when using link_to => no need to change things if a path changes.

??6:00 rake paths ??
