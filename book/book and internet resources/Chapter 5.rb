#Ruby also gives programmers the ability to change many details of the language’s operation within their own programs on the fly.
#This feature is called reflection.

#Community:
#ruby-talk mailing list, still one of the best places to discuss the Ruby language, as well as a useful resource
#with more than 200,000 messages archived at the list’s Web site (http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml).
#You can subscribe to ruby-talk yourself by sending an e-mail containing “subscribe” followed by your first name and then last name to ruby-talk-ctl@ruby-lang.org.
#Official english ruby website: http://www.ruby-lang.org/
#Ruby failed to catch on with all but a few ardent developers until 2000 and 2001 (with the 
#main Ruby Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.ruby being created in May 2000),
#IBM published an article with a brief overview of Ruby and an interview with Matz in 2000, and the much-revered
#Dr.Dobb’s Journal published an article by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt with a similar introduction in January 2001.

#Application framework:
#An application framework is a set of conventions, structures, and systems that provide an underlying structure to make application development easier. Ruby on Rails is such a framework for Web application development.

#Where to get help:
#Appendix C i boken finns en comprehensive list typ.
#Mailing lists: Mailing lists have always been popular havens for discussion about programming languages. Favored by the more technical members of any programming language’s culture, they’re a good place to ask questions about the internals or future of the language, along with esoteric queries that only a true language uber-geek could answer. They are not, however, suited for basic queries.

#IRC: IRC has proven popular with Ruby developers, and there are two particularly notable channels where almost–24-hour support for Ruby and Ruby on Rails is available as follows:
#• For Ruby language discussion: #ruby-lang on the irc.freenode.net server
#• For Ruby on Rails discussion: #rubyonrails on the irc.freenode.net serve
#Var inte en "help vamire".
#Be sure to respect that other users in the channel are not solely there to answer your questions; otherwise you might be deemed a “help vampire” and be ignored! However, with care, you can easily talk to some of the biggest names in the Ruby world on these channels.

#Documentation:
#The best documentation is the official reference documentation at http://www.ruby doc.org/ that provides full, though often basic, coverage of the standard Ruby classes and the most popular Ruby libraries and add-ins.
#API documentation generated automatically, www.ruby-doc.org/core/ This sort of documentation is for reference purposes only. (You don’t get a logical order to follow and there are no deep tutorials.)
#For libraries: Most Ruby libraries and applications use a similar scheme for their documentation, and the links to this are made available on their official sites. For example, Ruby on Rails’ API documentation is available at http://api.rubyonrails.com/

#Forums:

#Helping others:
#One of the reasons for programming communities is so that people can get help from others who are experienced with the language, but also to share knowledge and to develop useful tools and documentation together. Solely “taking” from the community is natural at the start of a developer’s experience with a new language, but it’s essential to give something back once you’ve developed some knowledge of your own. Ruby developers are proud that their community is one of the friendliest and easiest to get involved with, and there are a number of ways to make a mark.


#Se upp:
#"In the Ruby community, effort is often prized above prowess." Hur blir det med om en som inte kan försöker hjälpa en nybörjare, kan bli dåligt typ eller?

#Contributing practic knowledge:
#All open source Ruby libraries and applications have someone who is in charge of maintaining them, and if no guidance is provided on the project’s Web site, simply contact the maintainer and see whether you can contribute your code.
#Alternatively, if you don’t feel confident enough to supply code, but see large gaps in the documentation for a project—perhaps even in Ruby itself—maintainers are often ecstatic if you’ll supply documentation. You can learn more about how to document Ruby programs in Chapter 7. Many coders aren’t good at documentation or don’t have the time to complete it, so if you have a skill for it, contributing documentation to a project could make you very popular indeed!

#Weblogs:
#Seeing how hundreds of other programmers code and solve problems helps extend your mindset, and often the ideal code snippet or Ruby trick will appear on someone’s weblog at just the right time.

#Bra tips:
#Understanding the larger world around the Ruby language is extremely useful, as it’s from this community that most developers will get assistance, advice, code, and even paying work.
