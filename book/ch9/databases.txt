Databases:
first single file data organization:
CSV, Comma-Separated Values:
Each line represents a different person, and commas separate the attributes relating to each person. The commas allow you to access (and change) each attribute separately. Ruby’s standard library includes a library called csv that allows you to use text files containing CSV data as simple databases that are easy to read, create, and manipulate.

require 'csv'
CSV.open('text.txt', 'r') do |person|
puts person.inspect
end

You’re also forced to store simple arrays for each separate entry. There’s no nesting,
no way to relate one thing to another, no relationship to object orientation, and the data
is flat. This is ideal for basic data, but what if you simply want to take data that already
exists in Ruby data structures such as arrays and hashes and save that data to disk for
later use?
