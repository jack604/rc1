Testing:
Test driven development:

"This section provides only a basic overview of test-driven development. The topic is vast, and many books and resources are available on the topic if you wish to learn more."

Assertions, asserting that a certain condition is true.
A set of tests or assertions that test a single component or a certain set of functionality is known as a test case.

Behåll gamla test cases så att allt som inte ska ändras alltid fortsätter att fungera som det ska typ.

Test library:
Test::Unit official library for performing unit tests.
Unit testing is the primary component of test-driven development, and means that you’re testing each individual unit of functionality within a program or system.

...gives you a standardized framework for writing and performing tests.

create a test case by creating a class inheriting from Test::Unit::TestCase
 t.ex.:
class String
	def titleize
		self.gsub(/\s(\w)/) { |letter| letter.upcase }.gsub(/^\w/) do |letter|
			letter.upcase
		end
	end
end

require 'test/unit'
class TestTitleize < Test::Unit::TestCase
	def test_basic
		assert_equal("This Is A Test", "this is a test".titleize)
		assert_equal("Another Test 1234", "another test 1234".titleize)
		assert_equal("We're Testing", "We're testing".titleize)
	end
end

assert_equal (and other assert-methods) can also accept an optional third argument as a message to be displayed if the assertion fails.
